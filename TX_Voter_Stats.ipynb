    "* Write script to summarize raw SOS file. Want to get the following:\n",

    "    3. Voters by each of the [Congressional/state legislature] districts (by mapping back to precinct)\n",
    "        * Use the tx-data repo for mapping to these\n",
    "    4. Summarize missing fields\n",

    "**I need to decide on the most useful way to store these data.** If the data are provided already aggregated at different levels geographically (and aren't just derived aggregations of the more resolved data), then I should push this all into a database ultimately for further analyses. However, I suspect that the data will need to be aggregated by hand, in which case a database won't be needed (would effectively be a single table if I didn't include derived data, which I wouldn't do).

Given that there are more than 15.5M records in these voter rolls, to use this geocoder a volume sales contract would need to be worked up, as the pay-as-you-go monthly limits only go up to 500K requests. If we assume a roughly \\\\$3 USD per 1000 requests rate, it would cost $46,500 to get the latitude/longitude for all of these. Other cheaper options likely exist (e.g. OpenStreetMaps API Nominatim), but the accuracy of these is lower than Google's geocoder and thus unlikely to provide a significant gain in location accuracy."
