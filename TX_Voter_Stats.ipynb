    "This is a project I'm doing to parse Texas Secretary of State (SOS) voting files, develop automated cleaning scripts, identify missing fields/data and any patterns associated with that, and generally just do EDA through the whole thing.\n",

    "Specific ideas for this project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Want to have a way to pre-parse the SOS file to understand what data is in there / what might be missing.\n",
    "* Write script to summarize raw SOS file. Want to get the following:\n",
    "    1. Voters by county\n",
    "        * The largest geographical region\n",
    "    2. Voters by precinct\n",
    "        * Counties are made up of precincts\n",
    "    3. Voters by each of the [Congressional/state legislature] districts (by mapping back to precinct)\n",
    "        * Use the tx-data repo for mapping to these\n",
    "    4. Summarize missing fields\n",
    "    \n",
    "**I need to decide on the most useful way to store these data.** If the data are provided already aggregated at different levels geographically (and aren't just derived aggregations of the more resolved data), then I should push this all into a database ultimately for further analyses. However, I suspect that the data will need to be aggregated by hand, in which case a database won't be needed (would effectively be a single table if I didn't include derived data, which I wouldn't do).

Given that there are more than 15.5M records in these voter rolls, to use this geocoder a volume sales contract would need to be worked up, as the pay-as-you-go monthly limits only go up to 500K requests. If we assume a roughly \\\\$3 USD per 1000 requests rate, it would cost $46,500 to get the latitude/longitude for all of these.
